description: This was a first ever virtual event of PythonPune where everyone connected remotely. We had a good turn around on the YouTube live stream. The agenda was, [Design Patterns and Python Creational Patterns](https://github.com/pythonpune/meetup-talks/issues/82) by A.P. Rajshekhar and [Using Pipeline scripts in Jenkins](https://github.com/pythonpune/meetup-talks/issues/86) by Kumar Vipin Yadav.
